# Ardpoop:exclamation:

What can we say? This is a project we made to participate in **ShiftAppens 2k19**.

We put together JavaScript with Arduino and :shit: and after 48 hours of mixing everything...   ArdPoop was born!

:trophy:	:trophy:	AND WE GOT 2ยบ PLACE!! :trophy:	:trophy:	

Basically  Ardpoop is a **toilet monitoring system**. :toilet:

We use:

:boom: Reactjs

:boom: Nodejs

:boom: c (arduino)

What it can do:

- [x] It says if the toilet is occupied
- [x] Tells the toxicity level of the bathroom
- [x] **Compares uses and creates a top of who ruined the bathroom more**:exclamation:
- [x] We were drunk when we got the idea? Is the earth round? There are things in this world that nobody knows.
